Nowadays, people consume a lot of products and goods for daily eating and are eating in more varities. With increased interest in trying
new and diversified things including food choices, differnt resteraunts are constantly working to get best quality ingredients and in
fastest speed. As a popolar modern city, Toronto has differnt parts that are great for dining out. Specifically, west Toronto has 
been a possible location for a food supply supermarket to open its store. Since people scatter arount the city, it is hard for suppliers
to know the demand of food in a concrete way. Hence, I would explore west Toronto to see how places cluster and whether the clsuters formed
in west Toronto can give some insight as to whether it is a good idea to set up food supply supermarket ther or not.
