The data that can be obtained and used for finding out perfect location for opening health supplement store is obtained based on
developer acccount's capabilities, not simply on user's account capability. In particular, the data essential for the task deals

knowledge of these former information, poeple can use Python together with Forsquare API to find out places that cluster near each other
