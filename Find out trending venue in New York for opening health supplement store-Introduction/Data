To start, I will use Foursquare queries in Jupyter Notebook to find out the latitude and lontitude of New York city. Specifically, I will
use the geopy function to get latitude and longtitude of specific location such as New York. Then I will use the GET request fucntion 
to get the tredning location of New York.
