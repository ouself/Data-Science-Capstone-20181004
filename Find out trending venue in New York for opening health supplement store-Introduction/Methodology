To start, I begin websrapping the relvent data about neighbohood in the Canada neighborhood wikikipedia link
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M) and obtain the table part showing deatiled neighborhood list 
in Python Jupyter notebook. Then the data gets cleaned out in better organized format and transformed to dataframe that is
related only to borough west Toronto. Then I utilized Foursquare API and geopy function in Jupyter Notebook to find out the latitude and lontitude of 
west Toronto. 
Later on, to better find out clusters. I first use request function to find out top 100 venues in west Toronto read then into dataframe. 
The toatal 100 venues are then been better filter to get nearby venues for each neighborhood in west Toronto. These venues were 
organized showing its categorires and longtitude, latitude. Finally, with getting only top-10 venues per neighborhood, I built out 
clsuters and visualized the clusters using matplotlib. While setting cluster numbers of 5, each cluster is being diplayed in detail 
such as category, and its common venue in order.
